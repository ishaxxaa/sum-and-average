Arrays a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. It is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.
To create an array, define the data type (like int) and specify the name of the array followed by square brackets [].
To insert values to it, use a comma-separated list, inside curly braces
Example:-

   int marks[] = {25, 50, 75, 100};
Access the Elements of an Array
A specific element in an array is accessed by an index.
Array indexes start with 0. This statement accesses the value of the first element [0] in marks:
Example:-

int myNumbers[] = {25, 50, 75, 100};

printf("%d", myNumbers[0]);

// Outputs 25
All arrays consist of contiguous memory locations. The lowest address corresponds to the first element and the highest address to the last element.
